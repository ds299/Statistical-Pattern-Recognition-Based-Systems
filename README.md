# Index Trading Systems Results â€“ Statistical Pattern Recognition Based

As a market enthusiast, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by index and options charts. Over time, I noticed that certain price patterns tend to **repeat with high probability**, especially during specific market conditions. This curiosity turned into a habit of hypothesis building â€” testing whether the patterns I observed could be turned into profitable Trading systems.

This project is a result of that exploration.

By analyzing Index charts and recognizing recurring statistical behaviors, I developed **two distinct trading hypotheses**. I then **backtested these strategies using Python** with 1-minute OHLC index data, and accounted for real-world trading frictions such as:

- **Slippage**
- **Transaction charges**
- **Taxes**
- **Lot size calculation based on contract value** (dynamic position sizing)

Even after these cost adjustments, both strategies performed well, which is a strong validation of the underlying patterns.
